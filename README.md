# PentestingNotes
For storing new tools I learn about in CTFs so that I can refer to this when dealing with similar situations later

scan for ports using nmap

enumerate webpages for hidden directories with gobuster

enum4linux used to enumerate information from windows and samba (can find usernames and passwords with it)
use -e for enumeration

hydra for password cracking

netcat for listening for reverseshells
reverseshells can be written in python, bash, and many other languages
many different ways to use them

use johntheripper for encryption keys for ssh

linpeas used to find ways to escalate privelages

SCP to copy files to a remote machine

sudo -l to find possible SUID set files to exploit
gtfobins when a suid file is found

stegseek to crack images with a passphrase enabled

nikto -h to find vulnerabilities in a webpage

<script>alert('THM');</script> XSS alert test

https://tryhackme.com/room/xss refering to some xss code

 escape attributes, tags and bypass filters all in one
